## 🌟 Vision & Problem Statement

Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are the backbone of local economies, yet they struggle to access capital for growth. Traditional funding routes like bank loans are often slow and restrictive, while venture capital is inaccessible to most. On the other hand, everyday people want to invest in and support their local communities but lack a direct, transparent, and liquid way to do so.

**L.E.A.P. solves this by creating a decentralized marketplace where businesses can tokenize their equity, and anyone can invest in them, just like the stock market.**

## 💡 How It Works

L.E.A.P. allows verified business owners to convert their official Business Registration Certificate into a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT). This NFT serves as digital proof-of-ownership and the foundation for creating "equity tokens" for their business.

The valuation of these equity tokens is transparently linked to the business's financial health, primarily determined by their verified tax returns, creating a system where investors can make informed decisions based on real-world performance data.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🏢 Business Tokenization**: Secure portal for business owners to mint NFTs representing their business registration
- **📊 Dynamic Valuation**: Transparent valuation model using verified tax return data
- **🏪 Decentralized Marketplace**: Fully decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading business equity tokens
- **📈 Transparent Analytics**: Real-time dashboard showing business performance history
- **🔒 Secure Storage**: Documents stored on IPFS with on-chain verification

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React/Next.js** - Modern, responsive user interface
- **Web3 Integration** - Seamless wallet connectivity
- **Real-time Analytics** - Interactive charts and dashboards

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity** - Core business logic on EVM-compatible chains
- **NFT Standards** - ERC-721 for business registration tokens
- **DEX Integration** - Automated token trading mechanisms

### Storage & Verification
- **IPFS** - Decentralized document storage
- **On-chain Hashes** - Tamper-proof document verification
- **Oracle Integration** - Future Chainlink integration for data verification

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
node >= 16.0.0
npm >= 8.0.0
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/leap-platform.git
cd leap-platform

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install smart contract dependencies
cd contracts
npm install
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Start local blockchain (in contracts directory)
npx hardhat node

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

# Start frontend development server (in root directory)
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY=https://ipfs.io/ipfs/
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_id
```

## 🎯 User Journeys

### For Business Owners
1. **Connect & Verify** - Connect wallet to the L.E.A.P. platform
2. **Mint Business NFT** - Upload registration certificate and mint unique NFT
3. **Provide Financials** - Submit tax returns for valuation
4. **Launch Offering** - List equity tokens on the marketplace

### For Investors
1. **Discover** - Browse businesses by location, industry, or performance
2. **Research** - Review business profiles and financial history
3. **Invest** - Purchase equity tokens with cryptocurrency
4. **Trade** - Hold long-term or trade on the open market

## 💰 Valuation Mechanism

Our transparent valuation system works as follows:

1. **Data Submission** - Business submits 1-3 years of tax returns
2. **Metric Extraction** - Extract Annual Revenue, Net Profit, Growth Rate
3. **Valuation Formula**:
   ```
   Valuation = (Average Net Profit) × (Industry Multiplier) × (1 + Growth Rate)
   ```
4. **Token Pricing** - Total valuation divided by token supply for per-token price

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Q1 2026: Fractionalization & DAO Governance
- Enable NFT fractionalization for multiple owners
- Implement DAO voting for business proposals

### Q2 2026: Private Data Verification
- Integrate Zero-Knowledge Proofs for financial data privacy
- Enhanced security and trust mechanisms

### Q3 2026: Mobile App & Fiat Integration
- Launch mobile application
- Fiat on-ramp for non-crypto users
